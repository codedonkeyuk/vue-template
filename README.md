# SPA-template

Simple Typescript / Vite template containing. Starting point for future JS apps.

Vite has been configured to generate icons off a single svg file. This svg file is also used for social media image. You need to edit [./public/logo-square.svg](./public/logo-square.svg) to change all the images used in the app for social sharing and icons.

## This app might not be up to date

I update this project every time I use it, not every time there is a new update to a supporting library. So of you check it out, you might have to deal with some updates.
